# AI-Socratic-Clarifier Fixes

## Issues Addressed

1. **JSON Parsing Error**
   - Problem: The application was failing to parse JSON responses from the Ollama model, showing errors like `No JSON found in response: Error: Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 117)...`
   - Root Cause: The LLM (Ollama with deepseek-r1:7b) was returning malformed JSON, or was including additional text before/after the JSON block.
   - Additional Issue: Deepseek models use a "think and respond" pattern, which can add internal thinking that breaks the JSON structure.

2. **Improved Reliability**
   - Made the JSON parsing more robust to handle various edge cases and formatting issues from the LLM.
   - Improved the prompt to the LLM to increase the likelihood of getting properly formatted JSON.
   - Added advanced extraction techniques that work with the model's thinking process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced JSON Parsing
- Added multiple JSON extraction strategies in `direct_integration.py`:
  - Looking for JSON in code blocks (```json format)
  - Standard extraction by finding matching curly braces
  - Pattern matching for JSON-like structures with "issues" key
  - Advanced extraction of individual fields when JSON is malformed
- Implemented extensive error handling and fallback methods

### 2. Advanced JSON Cleaning
- Added handling for incomplete or unbalanced JSON
- Added extraction of just the issues array when other parts are malformed
- Improved field-by-field extraction when the complete JSON can't be parsed
- Better handling of nested JSON structures

### 3. Optimized LLM Parameters
- Reduced temperature to 0.3 for more deterministic outputs
- Increased max_tokens to ensure complete responses
- Ensured model parameters are properly applied to Ollama requests

### 4. Improved Debug Logging
- Enhanced error logging to capture detailed information about failures
- Added debug file output to `/tmp/ai_debug_response.txt`
- Captured both raw responses and processed JSON strings for troubleshooting
- Added progress output to show which extraction method is being used

## Testing
- Enhanced test script (`test_json_fix.py`) to show detailed debug information
- Captures stdout during analysis to help diagnose issues
- The script tests analysis with various input texts that are likely to trigger different LLM responses
- Improved error reporting with full stack traces to better understand any remaining issues

## How to Use the Test Script
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/ai-socratic-clarifier

# Run the test script
python test_json_fix.py
```

## Notes
- If issues persist, check the debug logs in `/tmp/ai_debug_response.txt`
- The fixes aim to be robust against a variety of LLM outputs while preserving the model's ability to think and reason
- Instead of trying to suppress the model's thinking process, we've implemented smarter extraction that works with it
- This approach allows the model to maintain its full capabilities while ensuring the application can still process the output correctly
