# AI-Socratic-Clarifier UI Fixes

This README documents the UI and functionality fixes applied to the AI-Socratic-Clarifier application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate Navigation Bar** - Fixed the issue where two navigation bars were showing at the top of the interface by consolidating them into a single navigation bar with the app branding and model status.

2. **Document Deletion** - Added functionality to delete documents from the document library, including:
   - Delete button in document preview modal
   - Delete button in document list
   - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
   - Animation and visual feedback during deletion
   - Robust error handling to prevent crashes when deleting documents with missing file paths
   - Document index cleanup functionality to remove invalid entries

3. **Vector Database Setup** - Improved vector database configuration:
   - Automatic check for embedding model configuration
   - Added `nomic-embed-text:latest` as the default embedding model
   - Automatic attempt to pull the embedding model if not present

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Apply All Fixes

You can apply all fixes at once by running:

```bash
cd /path/to/ai-socratic-clarifier
python apply_fixes.py
```

The script will:
1. Back up the original files
2. Apply all the UI and functionality fixes
3. Configure the vector database settings
4. Ensure the document storage directories exist

### Option 2: Fix Document Deletion Issues Only

If you're experiencing document deletion issues (freezing or errors), run:

```bash
python fix_document_deletion.py
```

This script focuses on:
1. Fixing document deletion error handling
2. Cleaning up the document index by removing invalid entries
3. Checking directory consistency

After running either script, restart the application to see the changes:

```bash
python start_ui.py
```

## Manual Changes (If Needed)

If you encounter any issues with the apply_fixes.py script, you can manually:

1. Copy `web_interface/fixed_app.py` to `web_interface/app.py`
2. Copy `web_interface/templates/fixed_integrated_ui.html` to `web_interface/templates/integrated_ui.html`
3. Copy `web_interface/static/js/enhanced/document_manager_delete.js` to `web_interface/static/js/enhanced/document_manager.js`
4. Create necessary directory: `mkdir -p web_interface/templates/components`
5. Copy `web_interface/templates/components/document_preview_modal.html` to create the modal template

## Vector Database Setup

The system uses the `nomic-embed-text:latest` model to generate document embeddings for semantic search. If the model isn't available, run:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```

## Additional Notes

- Document deletion operations cannot be undone.
- The vector database requires Ollama to be running.
- If you encounter issues with document embeddings, check the logs for errors and ensure the Ollama service is available.
