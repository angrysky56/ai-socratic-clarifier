## Configuration Changes

Added the following settings to `config.json`:

1. `advanced_rag`: Enable/disable advanced RAG features
2. `rag_context_limit`: Control how much document content to include
3. `use_model_for_rag`: Use the primary model for document processing when possible
4. Updated context length for Gemma 3 to 128000 tokens

## New Features

1. **Full Context Utilization**
   - Properly formatted document content with clear structure
   - Document chunking to fit within context limits
   - Clear instructions for the LLM on using document information

2. **Improved Document Retrieval**
   - Better relevance scoring based on multiple factors
   - Paragraph-level scoring for more accurate chunk selection
   - Option to include full documents in advanced mode

3. **Enhanced Document Processing**
   - Auto-detection of document types and appropriate processing
   - Improved multimodal model integration for image-based documents
   - Better fallback mechanisms for various document formats

4. **Primary Model Utilization**
   - Support for using the main model for document processing
   - Detection of multimodal capability in primary models
   - Integration with multimodal processing for better document analysis
