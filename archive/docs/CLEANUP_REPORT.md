# Repository Cleanup Report

## Summary
On March 16, 2025, the AI-Socratic-Clarifier repository was reorganized to improve maintainability and clarity. The repository was cleaned up by archiving old scripts, fixes, tests, and documentation files, while maintaining the core functionality.

## Changes Made

1. **Created an organized archive structure:**
   - `/archive/fixes` - Contains fix scripts and patches
   - `/archive/scripts` - Contains old start scripts and utility scripts
   - `/archive/tests` - Contains test files
   - `/archive/docs` - Contains old documentation and READMEs
   - `/archive/backups` - Contains backup files

2. **Moved approximately 85 files to the archive**, including:
   - Fix scripts and patches
   - Old start scripts
   - Test files
   - Various README and documentation files
   - Backup files
   - Template files
   - Integration scripts

3. **Created a unified entry point:**
   - Created a symbolic link from `start_ui.py` to `start_enhanced_ui.py`
   - Made both scripts executable with proper permissions

## Current Repository Structure
The repository now has a cleaner structure with:
- Core application code in `/socratic_clarifier` and `/web_interface`
- Enhanced functionality in `/enhanced_integration`
- Main entry point: `start_ui.py` (links to `start_enhanced_ui.py`)
- Core configuration files in the root directory
- Supporting directories for extensions, examples, etc.
- All old files organized in `/archive`

## Next Steps
With this cleaner structure, we can now focus on:
1. Reviewing and improving the UI
2. Addressing functionality issues
3. Enhancing the documentation
4. Improving the overall user experience

The organization should make it easier to locate important files and understand the application architecture.
