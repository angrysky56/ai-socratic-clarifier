# Socratic Analysis Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to enhance question generation, add user controls, and improve the integration of the Socratic Reasoning Engine (SRE).

## Issues Addressed

1. **Poor Question Quality**: The automatically generated questions were low quality and lacked depth
2. **Missing UI Controls**: No way to specify the maximum number of questions to generate
3. **SRE Integration**: The Socratic Reasoning Engine (SRE) wasn't properly integrated in the multimodal tab

## Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Question Templates

Added new high-quality question templates that are:
- More specific and contextually relevant
- Focused on deeper analysis and critical thinking
- Structured to avoid vague or generic phrasing
- Designed to prompt meaningful responses

Examples of improved templates:
```python
"Could you elaborate on what specific criteria define '{term}' in this context?"
"What measurable indicators would help quantify or evaluate '{term}'?"
"How would experts in this field operationalize the concept of '{term}'?"
```

### 2. Max Questions UI Control

Added a UI slider in the multimodal interface to control the maximum number of questions generated:
- Range: 1-10 questions
- Default: 5 questions
- Dynamic UI that only shows when "Socratic Analysis" mode is selected

### 3. SRE Integration

Enhanced the integration with the Socratic Reasoning Engine:
- Added checkbox to explicitly enable/disable SRE
- Modified backend to properly use SRE when analyzing text
- Set appropriate mode ('reflective') when SRE is enabled
- Pass the desired max questions parameter to the analysis engine

### 4. Improved Mode Parameter Passing

Better handling of mode parameters throughout the application:
- Direct passing of max_questions to the underlying analysis functions
- Proper mode selection based on the analysis type
- Better detection and use of SRE capabilities

## User Interface Changes

1. **New Socratic Options Panel**: 
   - Appears when "Socratic Analysis" mode is selected
   - Contains the max questions slider and SRE checkbox
   - Dynamically shows/hides based on selected mode

2. **Maximum Questions Slider**:
   - Adjustable range from 1 to 10 questions
   - Live display of selected value
   - Directly influences the number of questions generated

3. **SRE Checkbox**:
   - Enables/disables the Socratic Reasoning Engine
   - Checked by default for better question quality
   - When disabled, falls back to basic question generation

## How to Use

1. Select "Socratic Analysis" mode when processing a document
2. Adjust the "Maximum Questions" slider to your preferred number
3. Ensure "Use Socratic Reasoning Engine" is checked for best results
4. Process the document
5. Questions will appear in the "Questions" tab
6. You can click "Analyze in Reflective Ecosystem" to further analyze with the SRE

## Technical Implementation

The improvements were implemented by modifying:
- `multimodal.html` - Added UI controls
- `routes_multimodal.py` - Enhanced request handling
- `direct_integration.py` - Added support for max_questions
- `question_generator.py` - Improved question templates
