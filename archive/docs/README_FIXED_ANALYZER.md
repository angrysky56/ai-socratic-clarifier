# Fixed Analysis Module for AI-Socratic-Clarifier

This module provides a more robust solution for analyzing text and generating Socratic questions without relying on strict JSON format parsing.

## Key Improvements

1. **No JSON Dependency**: Instead of requiring the model to output valid JSON, this solution uses pattern matching to extract issues from natural language responses.

2. **Robust Pattern Matching**: The code uses regex patterns to identify terms, issue types, and descriptions in the model's response, regardless of format.

3. **Multiple Fallbacks**: If structured extraction fails, the code falls back to simpler methods to ensure useful results.

4. **Template-based Questions**: Questions are generated using templates matched to issue types, reducing dependency on model-generated questions.

5. **Full Debug Information**: All responses are logged for debugging purposes.

## How to Use

Simply run the script to test the analysis with some example statements:

```bash
./fixed_json_analyzer.py
```

## Integration

To integrate this approach into the main application:

1. Replace or update the `direct_analyze_text` function in `web_interface/direct_integration.py` with the logic from this script.

2. Update the prompt strategy to use natural language responses instead of JSON.

3. Use the pattern-matching extraction instead of JSON parsing.

## Benefits

- Works with any LLM, not just those good at producing valid JSON
- More resilient to model output variations 
- Preserves the model's ability to think and reason
- No dependency on specific output formats
- Easy to extend with additional patterns

## Performance Notes

This approach may be slightly less precise than well-formatted JSON, but it's far more robust against model variations and still captures the essential information needed for generating helpful Socratic questions.
